# Conversational AI for Non-Playable Characters

NPC interactions are still at their infancy when compared to the strides in development made on their surrounding aspects. This project focusses on enhancing and potentially redefining these interactions. We propose a conversational AI based approach that enables context-based interactions, allowing the plot of the game to be explored to much greater depths and in turn offering a much more immersive experience
